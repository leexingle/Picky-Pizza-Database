QUESTION 1

1)To enhance customer engagement and retention, the pizza company has imple-mented a Loyalty Program. Customers can earn points with each purchase, and based on the total amount spent, customer can redeem these points for rewards like free pizzas or exclusive discounts. The program consists of multiple tiers, of-fering increased benefits as customers accumulate more points, thus encourag-ing higher spending and repeat visits. In order to maintain the loyalty points, cus-tomer must visit the pizza restaurant at a rate for at least once per month. Thus, to identify eligible customers for the Loyalty Program, the company retrieves the transaction history of the customer during their purchase. For example, Ms. Emily Johnson is about to make a transaction, and the company retrieves her one-month transaction history to check if she is eligible for rewards on this purchase.

SELECT * FROM outlet_trans_view 
WHERE MONTHS_BETWEEN(sysdate, trans_time) < 1
AND cust_num IN(
    SELECT cust_num FROM customer 
    WHERE cust_lname = 'Johnson' 
    AND cust_fname = 'Emily')
